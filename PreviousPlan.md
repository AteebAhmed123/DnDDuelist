# DnD Duelist: Quantum Card Game - Development Plan

## Core Game Components

### 1. Card System
- **Base Card Class**: Abstract class with common properties and methods
- **Quantum Card**: Implementation of superposition mechanics
  - Two possible states that collapse upon play
  - Visual representation of dual states
  - Example: "Duelist's Paradox" (Attack 5 / Shield 3)
- **Standard Card**: Regular cards with deterministic effects
- **Card Properties**: name, description, effects, art reference

### 2. Deck System
- **Deck Class**: Container for cards with shuffle/draw functionality
- **Player Hand**: Subset of cards available for play
- **Discard Pile**: Used cards

### 3. Quantum Mechanics Implementation
- Use PyQiskit to simulate quantum states
- Implement superposition for quantum cards
  - Create qubit in superposition
  - Measure qubit to determine card outcome
- Visual feedback for quantum state collapse

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Card Structure
- Implement base Card class
- Create QuantumCard subclass with superposition logic
- Implement basic card effects (attack, defense)
- Test card state collapse

### Phase 2: Deck & Game Flow
- Implement Deck and Hand classes
- Create turn structure
- Add player state (health, resources)
- Implement basic game loop

### Phase 3: UI & Visualization
- Card rendering with dual-state visualization
- Animation for quantum collapse
- Game board layout
- Player feedback elements

### Phase 4: Game Balance & Polish
- Tune card effects and probabilities
- Add additional quantum cards
- Implement simple AI opponent
- Testing and refinement
