⚛️ Quantum Superposition as a Game Mechanic
🧠 Core Metaphor
Superposition = uncertainty + potential
A card isn’t one thing until it’s used — it holds dual potential. This captures the essence of quantum behavior: a state that collapses when observed.

🃏 What Does a Quantum Card Feel Like?
Imagine a card with two glowing halves:

One side hints at "5 Damage Attack"

The other at "Block 5 Damage"

It flickers between them

You play it, and the uncertainty resolves: BOOM — “Attack!”

This creates tension, surprise, and strategic guesswork.

🎯 Player Psychology & Strategy
💥 Tension
“If I play this, it might defend — but what if it attacks instead?”

“Can I bait my opponent into a bad move by playing a superposed card?”

🎭 Bluffing
Opponent sees your quantum card, but can’t know the outcome.

You play it early to confuse them or late to gamble.

🧩 Pattern Learning (Optional Depth)
Some cards may have biased probabilities.

Over time, players learn these — adding meta-strategy.

🔄 Design Variations of Superposition
1. Random Collapse
Card has equal (or weighted) chance of two effects.

Fully resolves only when played.

Example:
🃏 Quantum Strike

Might do 6 Damage OR heal 4 HP.
